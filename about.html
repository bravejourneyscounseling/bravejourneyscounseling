        Hi, I’m Maria, your partner on your journey of healing and wellbeing.
        With individual therapy I am here to support you as you navigate
        challenges and set goals. I’m here to guide you every step of the way.
        Let’s embark on this journey together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the owner and primary clinician of Brave Journeys Counseling. I am
        certified with CAMS-care, an evidence-based framework for working with
        suicidality. I primarily use ACT which teaches you to accept what you
        cannot change and live in a way that aligns and makes progress towards
        what is important to you. I am very collaborative in my approach,
        desiring input and feedback along the way. I would love equip you with
        tools, practices, and resources, to help you on their journey. Book a
        free consultation call!
